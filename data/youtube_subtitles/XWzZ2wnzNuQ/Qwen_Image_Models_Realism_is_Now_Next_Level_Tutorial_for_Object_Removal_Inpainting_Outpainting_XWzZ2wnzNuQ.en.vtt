00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.760
Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp;
three new presets that I have prepared. The first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.080
one is increasing the realism of Qwen image&nbsp;
models. If you remember, this was the result&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.480
that we were getting after training our model. Now&nbsp;
with this preset, we are going to get this result.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.400
When you look at the images, you can see how much&nbsp;
it is increasing the realism without losing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.920
complexity and features of the prompt. You see,&nbsp;
this is a very hard prompt, and if you need more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.080
realism, you can even increase the new LoRA weight&nbsp;
that we are going to use, a realism LoRA, and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.280
a more realistic image like this one. For example,&nbsp;
this was the base image we were getting. Now with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.960
the new LoRA, we are going to get this image. Here&nbsp;
another case, base image, and with the new preset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.560
we get this. Another example, base image, with&nbsp;
the new preset we are going to get this, and if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.520
increase further, we are going to get this. This&nbsp;
is a good example, base image, with the new preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.480
we are going to get this image, and we can even&nbsp;
further increase the realism like this. Remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.800
these are all hard prompts, not a prompt that you&nbsp;
generate a close shot of a face. From this base&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.960
image into this realistic image, or even further&nbsp;
into this image. Another case, from this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.560
into this image or this image. Another case, from&nbsp;
this image into this image or this image. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.200
see that it is hugely improving the realism of the&nbsp;
images. From this base image into this image or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.280
this image, it will look much better. For example,&nbsp;
from this image into this one. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.800
from this base image into this image. I mean, look&nbsp;
at the realism that we are getting. From this into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.720
this, this is a very, very realistic image. Or&nbsp;
you can even further increase the realism like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.880
this one. And pay attention, we are still keeping&nbsp;
the image as it is. We are just increasing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.000
realism. This is really, really good. I did&nbsp;
a huge amount of tests and experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.200
to come up with this workflow. With just the&nbsp;
addition of a LoRA with the proper settings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000
you are going to increase the realism. By the&nbsp;
way, these are just grid images. These are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.720
cherry-picks. Therefore, these are not perfect,&nbsp;
but understand that you are going to get a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.560
realism boost with this workflow. Or from this&nbsp;
image into this one, I mean look at the realism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.320
that we are going to get or this one. Here another&nbsp;
case from this one into this one or into this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.400
Here another case from this image into this one&nbsp;
or into this one. Or another case from this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.600
into this one or into this one. So you can get&nbsp;
a huge amount of realism with our new preset.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.920
This preset will not only work on trained models.&nbsp;
This was the base generation of the Qwen model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.880
and with using this new preset, you&nbsp;
can get up to this realism. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.200
from this base image into this image, this is&nbsp;
a huge boost of realism for this model. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.240
not perfect, but Qwen can do very hard&nbsp;
prompts very beautifully. So therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.920
this model has huge amount of potential with this&nbsp;
realism LoRA that we are going to have. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.000
LoRA doesn't only increase the realism of the&nbsp;
fantastic prompts. This is like a studio shot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.040
and you can increase your studio shot realism&nbsp;
like this case as well. Here another case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.800
this is a base image, and this is with the realism&nbsp;
LoRA. And even further, you can get to this.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.360
Another thing that I'm going to show you is&nbsp;
how to do inpainting on massive images really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.040
fast and really quickly. So we will just&nbsp;
inpaint the head like, mask it like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.280
and only that area will be generated by the model&nbsp;
so easily, so well. You will see it. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.240
we will be improving our images significantly from&nbsp;
this face to this face. I will show everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.760
Furthermore, I am also going to show you how to&nbsp;
outpaint images with an updated workflow that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.120
works amazing. You see, this is a massive outpaint&nbsp;
from this input image into this output image. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.160
is almost perfect. I will show even outpainting&nbsp;
the entire image from all sides. You see from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.720
1328 into 1536. We will be able to outpaint&nbsp;
massively even big images at once like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.800
So keep watching to learn all. Moreover, you will&nbsp;
be able to fix only certain parts of the images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.280
like removing this annoying text. You see the&nbsp;
text is gone fully. It is looking perfect. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.960
just inpainting this area of the image,&nbsp;
it will be super fast, super accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.560
It is not going to change any other area of&nbsp;
the image, just the masked area of the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.520
will be changed. So today, I will show both&nbsp;
realism and inpainting in SwarmUI very easily.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.560
And we have another preset, ultra realism. This&nbsp;
preset will work only on realistic prompts. From&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.560
this image into this image. This preset will&nbsp;
make the model to lose its fantastic prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.160
capability. You see this is the base generation&nbsp;
and this is the ultra-realistic generation. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.000
this will work good with realistic prompts.&nbsp;
I mean, from this image into this image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.880
this is much more realistic, but it loses&nbsp;
its fantastic prompt capability. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.840
from this image into this one, this is very,&nbsp;
very realistic or this one. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.000
from this image into this one. So this&nbsp;
ultra-realistic preset will work best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.840
in case of when you want to generate something&nbsp;
that exists in real life, something that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.200
get in your real life. It will make it much&nbsp;
more realistic. So if you are looking that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.120
losing the fantastic prompt capability but have&nbsp;
very realistic images, you will like this. I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.880
from this image into this one. This turns images&nbsp;
into like real photos because this another LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.160
is trained for only real images. However, this&nbsp;
is a choice. I mean from this to this, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.720
it will get a huge amount of realism from this&nbsp;
into this. I will explain all these presets.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.400
So first of all, download our latest SwarmUI&nbsp;
model downloader and installer. The link&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.840
will be in the description of the video.&nbsp;
Move the file into your existing SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.160
extract files, and overwrite previous files like&nbsp;
this. If you don't know how to install SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.920
ComfyUI, how to train, all of them are explained&nbsp;
in these tutorials video. You see this is the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.360
install tutorial video. This is install tutorial&nbsp;
on cloud like MassedCompute or RunPod, and this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.960
our training tutorial. Let me show you each one&nbsp;
of them. When you go to videos on our channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.360
this is our Qwen image models training video. If&nbsp;
you want to do train yourself or your product or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.440
your style, this is the video that you need&nbsp;
to watch. And this is the video that you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.000
to follow to learn how to install SwarmUI and&nbsp;
ComfyUI and use SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.120
And this is the tutorial that explains how to&nbsp;
install SwarmUI and ComfyUI on cloud machines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.800
like RunPod or MassedCompute. Okay, now we have&nbsp;
the newest files. First of all, start the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.360
start download models App.bat file. Run. First&nbsp;
of all, if you want to have all the image models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.720
you can download the image generation and editing&nbsp;
bundle. This will only download the new LoRAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:28.560
Which one of them? The new LoRAs that we are going&nbsp;
to use are these two LoRAs for realism. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:35.280
I have included the FLUX Dev Fill model which&nbsp;
I'm going to show you how to use to edit existing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.960
images very fast and very accurately. If you&nbsp;
want to individually download them, go to image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.960
generation models, go to Qwen image models, and&nbsp;
you will see the Qwen LoRA amateur photo. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.160
makes huge changes, not the one that I prefer.&nbsp;
And you will see Qwen LoRA skin fix version 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.600
This is the one that I prefer. I will show that.&nbsp;
And for the Flux fill model, it is inside Flux&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.920
models and you will see FLUX Dev Fill model. This&nbsp;
is for fixing images like removing text from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.240
certain part of the image. Once you downloaded the&nbsp;
models by clicking on them, update your SwarmUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.080
For updating SwarmUI, I will run this, Windows&nbsp;
update SwarmUI. Always have updated SwarmUI.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.080
Once the SwarmUI started, we need to get the&nbsp;
new presets. So there are two ways of getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.120
new presets. You can use the Windows preset delete&nbsp;
import. This is automatic way. For this to work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:37.040
you need to have SwarmUI running. So click yes,&nbsp;
it will back up your existing presets and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.560
import new presets. The manual way of importing&nbsp;
new presets is import presets, choose file, select&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.960
the latest preset file version 31, overwrite&nbsp;
existing presets and import, and this will update&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.560
your presets. Then click refresh, sort by name,&nbsp;
and you are ready to use our newest presets. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.240
for example, let's make an example of this image,&nbsp;
how to make it more realistic. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.200
as I have shown in previous videos, reset params&nbsp;
to default. Then go to presets, refresh, sort by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.160
name, and select this preset, Qwen Image UHD High&nbsp;
Realism. This is the preset that I prefer. Direct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:25.920
apply. You will see that it has selected Qwen&nbsp;
LoRA skin fix version 2. Now this is set as 0.6&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.760
for your self-trained models, but if you want to&nbsp;
use the base Qwen image FP8 scaled, increase this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:43.840
up to 1.2, 1.1, 1.2, it really works well. But&nbsp;
for my own trained models, I prefer 0.6. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.600
type your prompt, select your trained model if&nbsp;
you are using it on a trained model. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.600
I'm going to use my Qwen fine-tuned base model&nbsp;
FP8 scaled. All of these explained in the training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:02.400
tutorial. I will select my aspect ratio. Then I am&nbsp;
ready. I will just hit generate. As I have shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.440
in previous tutorial, it is recommended to disable&nbsp;
upscale, generate multiple images, pick the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.520
one you like, then enable upscale with that seed,&nbsp;
but I'm not going to show it again. So let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:23.200
our result with this realism LoRA. And we got our&nbsp;
image ready. Let's say this is too much changes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.480
you can reduce this or this is not real enough,&nbsp;
you can increase this. So if you want to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:35.920
with other presets as well, you can copy this&nbsp;
seed into here, just close these two LoRAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.920
go back to presets, and apply this one. Direct&nbsp;
apply. It will select the accurate LoRAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.600
but you will see that it has changed the base&nbsp;
model. Therefore, I'm going to switch back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.680
my used base model like this and generate and&nbsp;
let's see the difference. So this LoRA is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:00.480
powerful. Therefore, you can reduce this to 0.4.&nbsp;
It really works better that case. However, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:09.120
are generating a very realistic image, then 0.6 is&nbsp;
working very good. So this LoRA is very overfit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:16.320
overtrained for amateur photographs, for making&nbsp;
them more realistic. It's a choice whichever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.400
want, you can use, but this is how you change&nbsp;
the LoRA strength, the LoRA weight from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.600
So try different strengths, different weights,&nbsp;
and see which one is working best for you. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:34.800
this is the ultra realism preset result. So this&nbsp;
was my favorite preset for realism with keeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:42.640
the fantastic prompt capability of the model, and&nbsp;
this is the ultra realism result. It is up to you.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:50.800
So how you can inpaint an existing image with your&nbsp;
trained model? The logic is same for non-trained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.320
model as well. So first of all, load your&nbsp;
image and click edit image. Then apply the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.840
preset that you have used or you have. I'm going&nbsp;
to use this realism preset that we just made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.160
and I'm going to select my trained base model,&nbsp;
Qwen image base model. Then you see currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:18.160
this image is massive, 3488 to 1984. The model&nbsp;
is not able to inpaint or generate this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.760
directly. This was an upscaled image. Therefore,&nbsp;
I'm going to change this to one-to-one square.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.560
Now you will see that my working canvas&nbsp;
is only this yellow area. So I am able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.720
only make changes on this area. So the first&nbsp;
thing that I need to do is select my image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:43.840
click this move like this, and make sure that&nbsp;
the area that I want to make changes is inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.760
this yellow part and there are no transparent&nbsp;
pixels. This is important. Make sure that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:58.080
are no transparent pixels. And I recommend you&nbsp;
to delete this empty layer. Okay, like this. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:05.600
select mask and select paint brush and increase&nbsp;
radius. You can also use control. So I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:13.280
to inpaint the entire face like this. And turn&nbsp;
off the refine upscale. Okay, are we ready? Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.520
yet. So you will see that currently these are my&nbsp;
init image settings. I'm going to go presets and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.400
I am going to apply the inpainting preset. Direct&nbsp;
apply, and it will set the accurate settings. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:33.680
is going to use mask shrink grow. What this does&nbsp;
is it is going to use this full resolution 1328 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:41.840
1328 only on this masked area, not this entire&nbsp;
yellow canvas. So it is only going to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:48.960
part. And then there is one more thing. So with&nbsp;
Qwen, we are doing four steps by using the Qwen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:56.320
image edit lightning LoRA. Therefore, if I run my&nbsp;
generation right now, it will only do two steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:03.440
Why? Because my step count is 4 and my init image&nbsp;
creativity is 0.6. So when you multiply 0.6 with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:12.160
4, it is going to do 2.4 steps, which is ceiled&nbsp;
to two. Therefore, I need to set this into 7. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.000
Flux, you need to make recalculations. This is how&nbsp;
the number of steps works, but usually Flux preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.360
is working, I will show. So the prompt will be&nbsp;
ohwx man and generate. Now this generation will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.720
ultra fast. Why? Because it is only 1328 to 1328&nbsp;
with only four steps. So one advantage is that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.800
can generate multiple images like this, and I can&nbsp;
pick the best one. So you see this is the preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.360
Okay, this is the first generation. If I like&nbsp;
this, I can use this. You can generate multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.480
ones because this will be so fast. It is taking&nbsp;
like 15 seconds. Okay, this is another one. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.520
here. So generate as many as you want with seed&nbsp;
-1. Each generation will be different. Then look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:04.240
at the results. Okay, let's see. Let's say I&nbsp;
liked this one and I want to use this one. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.640
are we done? No, we need to merge this generated&nbsp;
image into our image. So drag and drop it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.200
here. You will see that there is now another&nbsp;
image in our working space. And before saving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:24.480
this image, delete this layer as well. So there&nbsp;
should be only two images like this. Go to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:31.920
three dots icon and store full canvas to history.&nbsp;
And then you will see that you got the new image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:38.880
So let's compare these two images. Okay, now we&nbsp;
have a comparison. So this was our base image and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:46.160
this is our inpainted image. From this image into&nbsp;
this image. This image into this image. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:53.520
significantly improved the quality of the face&nbsp;
like this as you are seeing. From this to this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.720
this to this. So there is another thing that&nbsp;
you can do. If you find that this has changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.280
the color or other thing, even though you have&nbsp;
made a lot of generations, what you can do is you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:13.360
can disable the mask shrink grow. So let's reverse&nbsp;
our changes. Okay, the reverse is not working, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:20.480
therefore we need to start from beginning. So drag&nbsp;
and drop our image, edit image, and again, we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.360
select the one-to-one square, select this base&nbsp;
image, move it like this, select the mask. Make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:34.560
sure to select mask, paint brush, select wherever&nbsp;
the area you want. Then okay, it is set. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:42.160
going to disable this mask shrink grow to show you&nbsp;
its effect. So now instead of only focusing on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.960
face part, it will draw the entire image but only&nbsp;
change the face part. This is another option that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:55.920
you can do. Whichever works better for you, you&nbsp;
can use it. So make a comparison and see which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:03.760
one is you are liking more. Furthermore, what you&nbsp;
can do is you can change this mask blur. Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.320
more blur can help or sometimes lesser can help&nbsp;
like this. So these are the options that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:18.480
do. Of course, you can change image creativity as&nbsp;
well. So if I make this 50%, like this, then to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:26.640
do four steps, I need to make step count 8 because&nbsp;
8 multiplied with 0.5 is four steps and generate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:34.320
So this way, I can make multiple generations,&nbsp;
multiple fixes and pick the best one that I like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.640
For example, this one, another generation. By the&nbsp;
way, when you look at it from far away like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.480
you won't notice the color difference. It will&nbsp;
look pretty, pretty good, like this one. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.000
so which one of them I like most? Let's say I&nbsp;
like this one most. This is looking pretty good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.960
one. Again, I will drag and drop it here.&nbsp;
Then I will delete this layer and I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.000
delete this layer. Then I will go three dots,&nbsp;
store full canvas to history. Alternatively,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.040
you can download full canvas and both of them will&nbsp;
work. So you can either download full canvas or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.840
just store it. And you don't need a trained model&nbsp;
to do this. You can do this with other models as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.280
well. Let me demonstrate you. So let's refresh.&nbsp;
Quick tools, reset params to default. Let's go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:27.360
presets and Flux dev models. Direct apply. Move my&nbsp;
image, edit image. First, change the resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:35.200
one-to-one square. Then move the image, select the&nbsp;
image, move it like this one. Then mask the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:42.080
that you want. So select mask, paint brush. I'm&nbsp;
using control button. Okay, I masked it. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.640
time, it is a Flux preset, so I will just say that&nbsp;
photo of a man and I'm going to increase the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.480
creativity because I want to change it into a&nbsp;
different man like this and generate. So this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.840
I'm going to use Flux base model to change it.&nbsp;
Actually, let's use the Flux SRPO model. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:09.520
is much more realistic. So I'm going to change&nbsp;
it into Flux SRPO. Or I can even use my Flux&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:16.080
SRPO DreamBooth trained model. Let's see that too&nbsp;
as well. I'm not sure what we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:24.240
And this is going to make 40 multiplied with&nbsp;
0.95 times steps. Always calculate the number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.840
of steps if you are using lightning LoRAs that&nbsp;
requires certain number of steps, you have to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:38.320
attention to that. Okay, it is changed into this.&nbsp;
We can make this even 100% like this one. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:47.120
see what we are going to get. Okay. Yeah, when we&nbsp;
make it 100%, it is losing its initial capability,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:55.120
so we should make this like maybe 99%. Probably it&nbsp;
wouldn't make a difference. So 95% is what we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.560
best. Therefore, we should try multiple times and&nbsp;
I can notice that there is some color difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:08.800
To make this color difference, we should make&nbsp;
this zero. Okay, let's try again. We didn't apply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:16.320
our preset. We have forgotten that. Let's apply&nbsp;
our preset. Let's make this 95%. Okay. So with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.400
inpainting, you have to make some tests. Sometimes&nbsp;
this color difference can't be fully prevented,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.720
unfortunately. This is what you need to test&nbsp;
and this is how you inpaint. In most cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:35.520
it won't be very noticeable, especially if it&nbsp;
is not like this one. Okay, I can even make this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:43.120
90%. So try mask blur 8. So keep trying until&nbsp;
you get a good result. I am also going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.680
my Flux DreamBooth model, Flux SRPO DreamBooth&nbsp;
model, and let's see what we get. Maybe I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:57.760
try this 60%. The lesser init image creativity, it&nbsp;
should make a lesser color difference. This has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.680
huge difference. So let's try 16 mask blur. I'm&nbsp;
not sure you need to test. This is a bigger mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:10.720
blur. It also has some hard difference. This was&nbsp;
very close. Okay, for example, this is inpainted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:18.080
with Flux SRPO. It is not yet great. So if you&nbsp;
don't want to get that annoying color difference,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:25.600
what you can do is delete the mask, add a mask&nbsp;
layer, and make a much more precise masking. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:34.000
if you make a much more precise masking and avoid&nbsp;
masking unwanted areas, you will minimize your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.040
color differences. This is probably more accurate&nbsp;
way of inpainting, rather than masking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:48.800
entire thing, just mask the area that you want to&nbsp;
inpaint, and you will get lesser color like this.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.080
So for outpainting, let's refresh our page,&nbsp;
reset params to default. We are going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.960
outpainting preset. This preset is going to&nbsp;
use Flux fill dev model. Outpainting is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.800
similar to inpainting. There are few tricks that&nbsp;
you have to follow. So I will click edit image&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.880
after I loaded my image. So you see, this is my&nbsp;
resolution. One of the most important thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.680
the resolution. As close as it is 1 megapixel, it&nbsp;
will work better. So for outpainting this image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:26.320
I am going to change my resolution to 1024&nbsp;
pixel. This is the best resolution. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:34.160
it can do bigger outpaintings as well. Normally,&nbsp;
you should do slower outpaintings. What I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:41.200
by that, for example, you should first outpaint&nbsp;
into this one, then increase it further. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.880
let's try this one. This is a big one. So I will&nbsp;
delete this mask and I will add another mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:55.040
layer and just paint brush like this. Then let's&nbsp;
generate eight images with different seeds to pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.520
the best one. This is pretty fast depending on&nbsp;
your resolution. Since this is 1 megapixel, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:08.480
going to be fairly fast. You see the first image&nbsp;
didn't work very well. Let's look at the newer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:15.600
ones. If you also see a preview like this, you can&nbsp;
just cancel that and move to the next one. That is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.440
another alternative. Okay, you see the third one&nbsp;
is going to work. If it doesn't work, then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.760
need to reduce your resolution and do smaller&nbsp;
steps outpainting. This is the logic. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:38.160
this one worked. So this is the image. So what is&nbsp;
the smaller step? Let's outpaint into 1024 to 896&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.480
first. So if you do smaller steps, it will work&nbsp;
much better. So you see, the first image is almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:51.120
perfect. And yes, it is done like this. Then what&nbsp;
I need to do is I will select this image, drag and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:57.840
drop it into here, and then delete this mask and&nbsp;
this image layer and click this three dots icon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:04.320
store current image to history. Then I can click&nbsp;
edit image and I can begin again. So I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:12.000
now expand it like this, and then just delete&nbsp;
this mask, make a new mask and like this. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.760
don't need to fill it entirely and generate. Pay&nbsp;
attention that I am not typing anything because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:24.480
is seeing this entire image and based on that,&nbsp;
Flux fill dev model is outpainting it. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:31.760
the logic of Flux fill dev model. And you see, now&nbsp;
it will work much better. How about bigger images?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.920
Can it do outpainting them as well? Let's try one&nbsp;
of them. Okay, I will cancel this, remove this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:46.320
image. Okay, for example, this is 1328 to 1328.&nbsp;
This is bigger than the native resolution of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:53.120
Flux fill dev model. So first, try outpaint like&nbsp;
this. Okay, first, let's delete the mask layer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:59.360
add a new mask so it will fit into here. Select&nbsp;
mask, select paint brush, type like this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.200
generate. Since this is a bigger image, it is&nbsp;
going to take longer to generate, but let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.480
what can it do. Can it do this resolution? This&nbsp;
is a pretty big resolution, almost 2 megapixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:16.080
So far, it looks like it is handling it good.&nbsp;
So this is the logic of outpainting. This way, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:24.800
can outpaint multiple times. Okay, it is done and&nbsp;
looking perfect. Yes, no issues. So first, let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.200
apply this. Okay, let's delete this layer, delete&nbsp;
this image layer, and store current image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:39.600
history. Then edit image. Now I will outpaint to&nbsp;
the this part like this. Or you can outpaint even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:47.520
further like this. How? Select image from here.&nbsp;
While hitting shift key, move it to the right like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:56.240
this. Okay. Then delete this mask layer, add a new&nbsp;
mask layer, select paint brush, add mask like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:04.400
and hit generate. Now we will be expanding from&nbsp;
both sides. We can even expand from all sides. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:11.120
is totally possible. I will show that too. And we&nbsp;
are expanding it into a massive resolution. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:19.680
let's cancel. Wow, looking pretty good, pretty&nbsp;
good. So let's do another example. This time I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:28.800
going to expand from all sides. So let's make this&nbsp;
bigger like this. You see? Then select the image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:35.040
move it with shift key like this so it will be&nbsp;
more proportional. Then delete this mask layer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:42.080
add a mask layer, paint brush, just this. This&nbsp;
is sufficient and hit generate. So now we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:49.040
be expanding from all sides. This way, you can&nbsp;
outpaint your images with a really, really good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:55.280
quality with our prepared outpainting preset. And&nbsp;
as you do bigger resolution, it will take more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:02.320
time, as you can assume, but it is working great.&nbsp;
So far, the preview is looking good. This way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:09.600
I can outpaint entire image at once. And it is&nbsp;
done. You see, even at the first try, I got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.280
very, very good result. This is the amazing&nbsp;
result. So this is how you outpaint images.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:22.560
Okay, last thing is removing something that we&nbsp;
want to have in images. So let's refresh the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:29.520
page. Quick tools, reset params to default. Go to&nbsp;
presets, Flux dev models, direct apply. Then from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:37.440
the models, select the Flux dev fill model. Load&nbsp;
the image that you want to fix, make changes, edit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.840
image. The first thing is setting the accurate&nbsp;
resolution. So our working canvas is now this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:51.440
yellow area. Select image, move. So move it into&nbsp;
the position which one you want to fix. I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:51.440 --> 00:28:00.160
to remove this text. This is a noise in my image.&nbsp;
Then I am going to select mask, paint brush,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:07.360
select the area like this. Now, for this one, I am&nbsp;
going to use init image creativity 1, and I am not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:14.160
going to enable mask shrink grow because this&nbsp;
way it works better. I'm not going to type any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.920
prompt. Therefore, it will analyze entire image&nbsp;
and it is going to only change this part. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:27.680
you can make the mask blur 1 or 4. You should try&nbsp;
multiple. I think some cases 4 is working better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:33.360
some cases 1 is working better. As you reduce&nbsp;
it, it is making more changes. This is what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:40.480
understand. For example, currently it is going to&nbsp;
remove it. Yes. You see, it has removed the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.720
This is not perfect, so I can try multiple times&nbsp;
or I can play with the mask blur and see which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:52.720
one will be perfect. Okay, second case doesn't&nbsp;
look like it has removed. Yeah, the third case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:59.840
it looks like it is going to remove. So with each&nbsp;
seed, it will make a different and when you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.880
provide any prompt, it is supposed to make the&nbsp;
changes according to the environment. Yes, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.600
is looking much better. And here another one we&nbsp;
are going to get. You can also increase the mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:22.560
size like this and try because we want it to have&nbsp;
more information. Okay, so currently these are my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:31.040
init image settings, creativity 1 and mask blur 8,&nbsp;
mask grow 0. I don't need mask grow. Okay, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.880
looking much better for example. So I'm going to&nbsp;
apply this. Drag and drop this image into here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.480
Delete the mask layer, delete this image. Why I&nbsp;
am deleting that image? Because currently you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:50.640
this image has a canvas like this. So if I store&nbsp;
full canvas to history, you will get an empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.360
space like this. You see? Because it is applying&nbsp;
this canvas too. So either I have to move them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:05.120
into the same place or I have to delete this, then&nbsp;
I will store full canvas to history. And yes. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.880
have only modified this part of the image, removed&nbsp;
that noise text by using the Flux fill model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.600
This is the logic of working with inpainting in&nbsp;
SwarmUI. As you do more practice, as you use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:25.680
more, you will get used to it. And hopefully, more&nbsp;
tutorials are coming soon. For example, now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:34.800
have Levo song generation model version 7. Now we&nbsp;
are supporting the newest full model. It is very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:42.480
very capable. It is able to generate up to 4.5&nbsp;
minute songs. I am still working it. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.600
fully done yet. So let me turn off my SwarmUI to&nbsp;
make an example for you. This is another tutorials&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.840
topic, but why not seeing now? Okay. This is our&nbsp;
interface. You see now we are supporting song&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.160
generation large, best quality. So let's generate&nbsp;
a song live and let's see. This is the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.840
song that we have. This is running locally,&nbsp;
so you are not bound to any other services,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:15.760
online services. And recently, one of the famous&nbsp;
AI music generation service stopped its working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:22.960
So this is the way of future, I say. And it is&nbsp;
getting pretty good VRAM optimized. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:30.800
I am going to also add FP8 scaled model loading&nbsp;
and perhaps block swapping as well to this model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.640
but currently it is working really, really&nbsp;
good. Okay, it is doing the diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.200
steps. You see it is only using 6 GB of VRAM while&nbsp;
doing the diffusion steps. Then it is doing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.360
VAE decoding and first it has generated&nbsp;
the audio tokens. It is super optimized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:53.200
but hopefully it will get even further optimized,&nbsp;
and it is using minimal amount of VRAM right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.560
The speed is very decent. For like a three&nbsp;
minutes of song, it takes like three to four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.400
minutes to generate. Maybe we will optimize&nbsp;
this further. Okay, all segments generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:15.760
File saved. Now let's listen our generated&nbsp;
song. So you see it is 2 minutes 53 seconds.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:35.520
I've been walking through the shadows of my&nbsp;
mind. Searching for the words I couldn't find.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:51.120
Every heartbeat echoes in the dark, waiting for a&nbsp;
flame to light the spark. But I'm still breathing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:51.120 --> 00:33:01.120
still believing that tomorrow brings&nbsp;
a brand new start. I'm still fighting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:11.120
still surviving with the fire burning in my heart.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.840
Yes, as you are seeing, it is pretty good.&nbsp;
This is locally running on my computer. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.600
am still working it and hopefully it&nbsp;
will become even better. But you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.360
already download it from our Patreon post&nbsp;
and install and use it on your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.943
on RunPod, or on MassedCompute. Hopefully&nbsp;
see you in another amazing tutorial video.
