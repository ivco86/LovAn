00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.980
This is Tony's
Chocolonely.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.700
Tony's costs more than
your average Hershey's

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.830
bar. But how does it
stack up?

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.450
Tony's tastes a lot more
like, um, quote unquote,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.470
real chocolate.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.330
I could eat more of this
than, you know, Hershey's.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.940
So if we look at dollar
sales, consumers love

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.600
chocolate. We spent $19
billion, which was up

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.940
about 6% in 2023 over
2022.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.230
I would pay double price
for Tony's for sure.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.100
It's also more ethical,
right?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.790
The company started by
accident. The impact came

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.480
first.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.240
With its bold and colorful
packaging, this Dutch

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.970
brand is trying to
achieve a huge mission: to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.340
make chocolate 100% slave
free.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.210
Today, 60% of the world's
cocoa production comes

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.120
from Ghana and the Ivory
Coast, where over 1.5

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.730
million children work on
cocoa farms.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.890
As Tony's, we're not
interested in about just

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.140
doing it the right way
for ourselves.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.270
We're interested in
changing the whole

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.810
industry.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.860
Tony's Chocolonely brought
in $162 million in revenue

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.660
in fiscal year 2023.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.540
So how did a relatively
new company from Europe

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.330
make a place for itself
in America's crowded candy

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.960
aisles?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.590
The great thing about
being the CEO of a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.170
chocolate company is you
get to justify eating

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.360
chocolate every day, so
you have to be careful.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.720
I'm Douglas Lamont and
I'm the chief chocolonely

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.550
at Tony's Chocolonely.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.390
So even though we're a
Dutch brand by origin, our

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.850
founding story actually
starts in the US.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.120
In 2001, two US
politicians introduced the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.910
Harkin-Engel protocol, an
international agreement

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.950
that was signed by eight
of the biggest chocolate

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.040
brands, including
Hershey, Nestle and Mars.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.190
The goal? To end child
labor and slavery in the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.420
chocolate industry.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.060
Two years later, a team
of Dutch journalists,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.370
including Teun van de
Keuken, decided to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.740
investigate the progress
the chocolate industry had

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.310
made.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.800
There were still huge
numbers of children

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.020
working illegally on
cocoa farms in West

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.050
Africa. They felt very
strongly that this needed

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.790
to change and needed to
be addressed.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.410
How did they go about it?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.230
Well, as well as
reporting the facts, they

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.420
decided that they were
going to get themselves

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.090
arrested. And Tony walked
into a police station in

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.430
the Netherlands, having
just eaten a chocolate bar

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.560
from one of the big
chocolate companies, and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.020
insisted that he was
arrested because he was

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.240
aware that there was
illegal child labor in

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.520
this chocolate bar. And
under EU law, if you're

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.620
aware of something and
you still allow it to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.510
happen and you
participate in that,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.340
you're breaking the law
and can go to prison for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.650
four years. Obviously the
policeman looked at him

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.960
rather strangely and
didn't know what to do

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.070
with this. Teune

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.530
also decided to persuade
the world's largest

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.990
chocolate makers to
change their behavior.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.270
Willy Wonka, the Charlie
the Chocolate Factory

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.350
film, was launching in
2005.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.220
They tried to persuade
Nestlé, who had the rights

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.370
to that bar, to introduce
a child labor free bar.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.400
They couldn't do that and
decided that they needed

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.360
to launch a bar for
themselves.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.650
And that is how Tony's
Chocolonely was born.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So, Tony, because Teune,
the journalist, the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.290
international name is
obviously Tony, and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.960
Chocolonely because they
felt that they were on a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.420
very lonely journey to
change the industry.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.820
But what we've also done
to raise awareness of the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.610
inequality and the supply
chain is to make sure that

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.650
our bar does not look
like a normal bar.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.800
And what that symbolizes
is the inequality in the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.690
supply chain that, you
know, some people have a

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.840
big chunk, other people
get a very small chunk.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.540
In fact, some of the
uneven shapes are actually

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.460
the West African
countries where Tony's

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.110
sources its cocoa beans.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.780
As a Dutch brand, it
initially became very

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.600
famous and grew very
quickly to become one of

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.540
the leading chocolate bar
brands in the Netherlands.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.740
From about 2014-15
onwards, they started to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.210
expand internationally.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.610
Tony's Chocolonely was
launched in the US in

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.450
2015. Today, Tony's bars
are sold nationwide at

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.120
major retailers like
Whole Foods, Target and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.780
Walmart.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.230
The US is clearly a really
important market for us,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.000
not not just because of
the scale, but we you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.720
know, we really see that
consumers increasingly are

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.800
becoming more conscious
of the types of products

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.330
they buy, the brands from
whom they buy, the reasons

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.880
behind those brands, you
know, and what we believe

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.290
at Tony's, we offer and
deliver.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.960
And that seems to be
resonating and working.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.720
Our most popular flavor
is our sea salt caramel

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.630
bar. It's universally
popular, closely followed

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.680
by our milk bar.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.290
Tony's Chocolonely is
making a name for itself

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.970
in a very crowded field.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.990
The top five manufacturers
control almost 90% of

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.870
sales. So if we look at
all the other small

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.970
players that are out
there, what we see is that

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.480
150 manufacturers
actually account or have

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.760
sales greater than $1
million in the US.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.640
Tony's revenue grew 23% in
fiscal year 2023 to $162

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.360
million. It also received
around $22 million in

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.400
funding. While the
company has been growing

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.220
at a steady pace, it's
not making a profit yet.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.270
We're not profitable.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.340
We're at a break-even
position broadly as a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.550
company, we're making
that choice to invest in

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.990
growth in the US market.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.270
We've just launched
manufacturing capability

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.000
and capacity in Chicago
that takes upfront

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.100
investment. What we know
is essential is that we

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.890
demonstrate that we can
be a scaled, profitable

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.200
business, proving that
we're not just a chocolate

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.390
distribution charity, but
a profitable, successful

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.130
business is part of our
impact.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.010
Besides its main chocolate
business, Tony's

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.440
Chocolonely also has a
second business called

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.400
Open Chain.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.580
So any brand or any
private label retailer can

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.810
source cocoa from Tony's
open chain and put it into

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.830
their supply chain.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.440
In an ideal world that
will be much bigger than

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.500
Tony's Chocolonely, we
have huge ambitions to get

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
to 5% of the cocoa beans
sourced through West

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.980
Africa, and that's only
possible if other partners

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.140
come on board with us and
in the end, grow much

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.450
faster than just the
beans that come from

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.680
Tony's Chocolonely.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.140
Tony's recently partnered
with fellow socially

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.340
conscious brand Ben and
Jerry's.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.460
They've made a commitment
to source all of their

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.430
cocoa beans for their ice
cream pieces through

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.570
Tony's open chain.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.390
And so for a big brand
like Ben and Jerry's, with

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.970
a high commitment to
ethical sourcing, to come

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.800
on board with Tony's open
chain to look at what we

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.170
did, to compare it to
what they were, you know,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.610
the good work they were
already doing on the

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.950
ground and decide that
our approach was the right

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.040
way forward, was a big
credit to the work that

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.080
our teams have done on
the ground.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.240
We have 100% traceability
of our beans.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.930
We know every farmer that
provides beans to us, and

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.030
so obviously we source
and collect those beans.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.030
In West Africa, we
convert a number of those

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.820
beans into cocoa butter i
n West Africa.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.220
We then transport some
beans and that cocoa

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.880
butter to either to
Europe or to the US, where

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.640
that's turned into liquid
chocolate. Combined with

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.160
all the interesting,
great flavors that we have

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.360
into bars.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.090
Tony's Chocolonely is
trying to stop child labor

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.030
by addressing the root
issue: paying its farmers

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.110
a living wage.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.200
What happens is those
farmers are not able to

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.390
have labor to support
them, and in the end,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.480
their children end up
working illegally on cocoa

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.260
farms.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.170
In 2021, Tony's was
removed from the slave

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.610
free chocolate list
because of its

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.590
relationship with
manufacturer Barry

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.530
Callebaut, which it used
to process beans into

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.840
liquid chocolate. The
company said in its

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.690
defense that its cocoa
beans are fully segregated

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.790
in Barry Callebaut's
process, and that the

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.010
partnership with the
manufacturer allows it to

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.380
scale up its production
on a global level.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.810
In a statement to CNBC
Make It, Tony's

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.030
Chocolonely said it will
continue to source cocoa

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.700
beans from West Africa as
it works to solve the

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.660
problems there.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.210
So what we believe in is
radical transparency.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.030
So we report on every
single case of child labor

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.920
that we find in order to
address it.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.840
And it's only by being
transparent about the

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.050
problem and then actively
addressing it that you

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.070
deal with the systemic
issues.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.610
In fiscal year 2023, the
company reported that it

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.400
had found around 1,000
incidents of child labor

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.570
in its supply chain.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.700
Chocolate consumption in
the US actually dipped 6%

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.120
in 2023, but Americans
were still spending more

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.140
than ever on it.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.780
Well, part of the reason
why we're seeing a decline

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.050
in consumption is that
most of us, even though we

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.120
love chocolate, are still
being faced with higher

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.870
prices. In 2023,
chocolate prices actually

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.280
increased 12%, which is a
significant increase.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.290
So faced with those
higher prices, consumers

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.770
once again are deciding,
do I need this or do I

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.430
want this?

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.920
Besides the chocolate
bars, Tony's Chocolonely

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.080
has been introducing new
products to the market

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.240
like bite-sized
chocolates and seasonal

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.960
products.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.670
We've obviously got lots
of seasonal products,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.040
including, you know, our
advent calendars.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.050
Behind one of the doors,
we don't have a chocolate.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.180
Another great way to tell
the story about the

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.010
inequality and the supply
chain. So when you don't

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.710
get a chocolate in your
advent calendar, you want

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.640
to understand why.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.680
So where are the original
founders today?

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.850
They're still
shareholders, and they

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.790
still regularly pop in
and see us and see the

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.680
progress that we're
making as a brand.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.540
We're really excited
about where the brand is

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.060
going and where Tony's
open chain is going,

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.640
because we really feel
that industry change is

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.500
now possible. We're
proving that we can do

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.610
this at scale.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.740
And also, with
legislation being

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.540
tightened up around
deforestation and

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.690
traceability, we feel
like all the right things

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.060
are coming into place to
drive wider industry

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.070
change. We're not going
to rest until we deliver

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.950
on our mission to end
exploitation in the cocoa

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:45.610
industry.
