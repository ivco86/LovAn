00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.960
In this video, I'm going to push the two smartest&nbsp;
AIs to their limit. Gemini 3 can create beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.200
one-shot scenes, like this one it created to&nbsp;
introduce itself. And I'll be comparing it to GPT&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.600
5.1, or more specifically GPT 5.1 Codex Max (Extra&nbsp;
High), but that's not quite as catchy. For really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.600
difficult tasks, these are apparently the two best&nbsp;
AIs in the world. So, I'm going to test them on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.880
complex simulation tasks that require planning,&nbsp;
testing, and iterating over time. The first is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.320
bird flocking simulation set in a beautiful&nbsp;
nature scene, and the second will be a full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.760
city simulation with people and traffic. First&nbsp;
is bird flocking. It has to be a 3D simulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.840
with realistic bird flocking behavior. I want it&nbsp;
set in a beautiful nature scene with vegetation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.760
trees, and any extras the model wants to add. I&nbsp;
also want a bird view where the camera follows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.120
a bird to see what it's like to be in the flock.&nbsp;
It has to use ThreeJS, which is the most popular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.760
JavaScript animation library. If you've seen some&nbsp;
of my other videos, you know the models are pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.040
good at animating with it. They can use any other&nbsp;
tools they like, and it has to have basic controls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.080
for looking around the simulation. That's a lot&nbsp;
to get done all at once. So, I'm going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.320
agentic coding tools to let the models work for a&nbsp;
long time on the task. I'll use Gemini 3 with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.960
Gemini CLI and I'll use GPT 5.1 Codex Max with&nbsp;
the Codex CLI. Both with maximum reasoning. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.000
models have to run the simulation themselves to&nbsp;
test it and take screenshots to view what their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.440
simulation actually looks like and see what can be&nbsp;
improved. And I'm going to ask that every element&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.960
is as detailed and realistic as possible. I'll add&nbsp;
the full prompt in the video description if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.680
interested. This is Gemini 3's bird flocking&nbsp;
simulation. We can see straight away the birds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.680
are flocking in a pretty realistic way. And the&nbsp;
nature scene looks like a foggy river delta with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.040
3D terrain, trees, rocks, and transparent&nbsp;
streams. Although, if you look closely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.720
the trees don't actually touch the ground. It's&nbsp;
quite a big world, and the birds explore a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.280
of it if you let it run. But they do get caught in&nbsp;
these circles. It has the controls we asked for to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.120
tune the simulation parameters like how close the&nbsp;
birds like to fly to each other and their speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.800
And if you mess with it, you can get some weird&nbsp;
behaviors. The bird view is exactly what I wanted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.880
but can be a bit shaky and sometimes breaks. But&nbsp;
here we can get an idea of how the simulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.200
works. Each bird is flying around independently&nbsp;
based on some rules like when to turn towards or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.040
away from nearby birds. And the flocking behavior&nbsp;
you see is emergent from these individual bird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.480
rules rather than being programmed in at a high&nbsp;
level. Gemini didn't bother to make the birds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.520
interact with the environment and they go straight&nbsp;
through the trees and the ground. But overall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.160
I'm pretty impressed with Gemini getting this on&nbsp;
its first try with no intervention from me. GPT&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.720
5.1 Codex's bird flocks seem a bit more fluid and&nbsp;
natural, but a few seconds in, they do go flying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.400
out of the world and into the abyss, but they do&nbsp;
eventually come back. The trees meet the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.840
correctly for this one, but the water feature is&nbsp;
nowhere near as good as Gemini's. The bird mode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.120
is very smooth and looks great when the birds are&nbsp;
actually flying over the world. And the birds do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.320
hit the ground on this one, which is a bit weird,&nbsp;
but I guess more realistic than Gemini's birds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.520
which go straight through the ground. We have&nbsp;
the simulation controls similar to Gemini's,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.320
which includes bird ground clearance, but even&nbsp;
with that all the way up, they still sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.520
hit the ground. If you play around with the&nbsp;
controls, you can get some weird flocks. I found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.280
this lonely bird and managed to catch the moment.&nbsp;
It detects a nearby flock and turns to join it.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.760
Codex's birds were much nicer to play with than&nbsp;
Gemini's, but Codex also made the biggest mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.120
of letting the birds fly off the map. To me, they&nbsp;
both did really well with different pros and cons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.920
so I'm going to make the next challenge even more&nbsp;
difficult to see if they can handle it. The next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.000
challenge is to build an entire city. I want it&nbsp;
to be a 3D simulation in ThreeJS. It has to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.760
buildings, streets, vegetation, parks, and other&nbsp;
things that should go in a city. It needs to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.520
people walking around and cars driving around&nbsp;
with realistic traffic interactions. I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.880
to use the agentic coding tools again to let the&nbsp;
models run and test their code, take screenshots,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.880
and iterate based on what they see. Here is Gemini&nbsp;
3's city. It took a few tries. It built a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.760
of cities that just didn't work, and it could&nbsp;
clearly see they didn't work from the screenshots,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.880
but it just didn't care. And even after I asked&nbsp;
Gemini to fix it, it just pretended that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.160
fixed. But eventually it built this city which&nbsp;
has cars and people walking around just like I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.920
asked. These parks are scattered around and each&nbsp;
one is a bit different. The people have a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.960
walking animation and they walk on the sidewalks&nbsp;
although some of the sidewalks are missing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.080
they use the road crossings but they do not care&nbsp;
for red lights and they walk straight through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.800
cars. The cars do drive on the road and stop at&nbsp;
traffic lights but the rules are a bit strange.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.520
Like this car is driving on the right and then&nbsp;
switches to the left. After about a minute, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.480
causes the entire city to get backed up while cars&nbsp;
wait for someone on the wrong side of the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.680
to move. You can also change the time of day and&nbsp;
nighttime has a very different vibe. But overall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.960
I'm going to say this is a pretty good job from&nbsp;
Gemini 3. Codex's city looks okay from a distance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.320
but is full of weird issues. Half of the&nbsp;
streets are oriented the wrong way and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.240
things just seem to be placed randomly.&nbsp;
Like trees are in the middle of the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.600
and traffic lights don't point the right way. I&nbsp;
thought the cars were driving sideways at first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.800
but the lights and everything are on the right&nbsp;
way, so they are just very wide. The traffic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.880
only really functions for about 10 or 15 seconds.&nbsp;
Then the cars just seem to stop and never start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.920
again. The people are also nowhere near as good&nbsp;
as Gemini's. They kind of just float around and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.200
have no walking animation. Overall, I'm going to&nbsp;
give Codex a fail on this one. There are just too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.320
many issues. I gave it a couple of tries, too,&nbsp;
because Gemini had a couple of failed attempts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.040
It was much more reliable than Gemini at getting&nbsp;
it working, but it just couldn't get it much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.920
better than this. I think the main issue is it&nbsp;
just doesn't look at the screenshots properly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.640
so it just misses obvious glaring issues&nbsp;
right in front of it. Even though I love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.000
Codex and use it everyday, I'm going to say&nbsp;
Gemini wins this comparison. It did struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.960
with the agentic coding more than GPT 5.1 Codex,&nbsp;
but its spatial reasoning is on another level.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:04.000
Thanks for watching. I'll put the full prompt and&nbsp;
process I use in the video description. Cheers.
